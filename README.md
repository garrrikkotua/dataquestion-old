# DataQuestion
**AI powered BI for non-analysts**

SQL is a widely adopted language for working data, but still many people can't use it to get data they need. The idea of this project is to allow everyone ask simple data questions without any knowledge of SQL.

The AI part of this repo (namely jupyter notebook) is based on [TabularSemanticParsing](https://github.com/salesforce/TabularSemanticParsing) from Salesforce.
